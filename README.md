# This program is using different MachineLearning algoritms to classify the different types of flowers from a dataset

# How it works:
- First, the program will create a few graphs with the available data for better visualisation of it, with every component caracteristics.
- Then it will split the dataset in 2: the training set and the test set
- We will train the model using a liniar model, after that, the model will be tested on the test set and show the confusion matrix
- Lastly, similar to what we did earlyer, we will train the program using different ML models(Polynomial and RBF)
